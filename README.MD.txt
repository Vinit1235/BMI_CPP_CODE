# BMI Calculator

A simple C++ program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and mass.

## How It Works
The program calculates the BMI using the formula:

\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{m}{h^2}
\]

Where:
- **m** is the mass (in kilograms)
- **h** is the height (in meters)

The user inputs their height and mass, and the program outputs the calculated BMI.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler like **g++**.
- A working development environment to compile and run C++ code.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git
