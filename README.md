# Project Title: BMI Calculator

A simple C++ program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and mass.

## How It Works
This program calculates the BMI using the formula:
\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{m}{h^2}
\]
where:
- **m** is the mass (in kilograms)
- **h** is the height (in meters)

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Development environment to compile and run C++ code

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal.
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ bmi_calculator.cpp -o bmi_calculator
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./bmi_calculator
   ```
5. Enter your height and mass when prompted.
